C/C++ repository
This repository is for projects I am developing in C/C++. I am currently working on a detailed AI library. This repository includes the source files belonging to what I have developed thus far for this project. Currently, the AI library contains an extensive math function library, random number generator library, a tensor library (still in development), and an OpenCL library (still in development) that will allow for GPU versions of most the other libraries.
